# About me

Hi there! I'm Haley Staudmyer (she/her). I'm a climate scientist at the University of California, Irvine studying extreme heat and human health. I'm a science communicator. I  think a lot about climate justice, community-based participatory research, and how we can use tools from the social sciences to improve the geosciences.

When I'm not doing science, I enjoy being walked by my dog, playing & writing about board games, and listening to an unfathomable amount of audiobooks and podcasts.
